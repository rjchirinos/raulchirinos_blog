# Ra√∫l Chirinos | Blog

## What is this about?
Well, I think the best way to learn something is by doing, and that's exactly what I'm doing here.

Actually I don't want to have a blog and I don't really want to publish things on it almost by now.

I'm just trying to learn Django a little bit everyday.

## Can I take a look
Of course, but... How I'm not sopposed to make a public blog I don't have this hosted in any server, so you'll have to run the server by yourself

I make it easy for you because I make an environment for this project, so you don't have to install nothing.

Just clone the repo:

    $ git clone https://github.com/rjchirinos/raulchirinos_blog.git

Run the environment:

    $ source b_env/bin/activate

Run the server:

    $ python manage.py runserver

And you will be able to look it in your local host by typing localhost:8000 in your browser.
